The aim of this project was to develop an Android application that
combines machine learning and geolocation to enhance a touristâ€™s
experience whilst exploring a new city, or area. This application
presents users with Points of Interest, each of which has a number of
potential unique stories. The main focus of this project was to develop
a recommender system to present relevant collections of stories,
tailored to each user. The system generates a profile of each user
based on the level of interest shown by the user in particular Points of
Interest. This profile is subsequently used to recommend stories and
Points of Interest to the user.

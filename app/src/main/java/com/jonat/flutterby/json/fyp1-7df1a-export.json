The family were proud that the hotel was the first unlicensed hotel in Ireland.Douglas Vance,who managed the hotel from 1944 until 1982,persuaded the Musgraves that a license to serve alcohol was necessaryfor a modern hotel.The hotel hosts the annual festival club of the Cork Jazz Festival.The Musgraves sold the hotel in 1977 and it is now part of the Gresham Hotel Group.Its current name is the Gresham Metropole Hotel.It was extensively refurbished in 2003.The Musgrave family remain prominent in the cash - and - carry business and the food industry.",

          "story" : "John Redmond‌In the late 1830s, Mulgrave Street was developed to provide more direct access between‌‌ the Butter Exchange and the docks on the east side of St Patrick's Bridge. The project was financed by Cork butter merchants and named after the Earl of Mulgrave, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1902 Mulgrave Street was renamed in honour of the Irish Nationalist politician John Redmond.John Edward Redmond was an Irish nationalist politician,barrister,and MP in the British House of Commons.He was best known as leader of the moderate Irish Parliamentary Party(IPP) from 1900 until his death in 1918. He was also leader of the paramilitary organisation the Irish National Volunteers(INV).He was born to an old prominent Catholic family in rural Ireland;several relatives were politicians.He took over control of the minority IPP faction loyal to Charles Stewart Parnell when that leader died in 1891. Redmond was a conciliatory politician who achieved the two main objectives of his political life: party unity and,in September 1914,the passing of the Irish Home Rule Act.The Act granted limited self - government to Ireland,within the United Kingdom.However,implementation of Home Rule was suspended by the outbreak of the First World War.Redmond called on the National Volunteers to join Irish regiments of the New British Army and support the British and Allied war effort to restore the 'freedom of small nations' on the European continent,thereby to also ensure the implementation of Home Rule after a war that was expected to be of short duration.However,after the Easter Rising of 1916,Irish public opinion shifted in favour of militant republicanism and full Irish independence,so that his party lost its dominance in Irish politics.In sharp contrast to Parnell,Redmond lacked charisma.He worked well in small committees,but had little success in arousing large audiences.Parnell always chose the nominees to Parliament.Now they were selected by the local party organisations,giving Redmond numerous weak MPs over whom he had little control.Redmond was an excellent representative of the old Ireland,but grew increasingly old - fashioned because he paid little attention to the new forces attracting younger Irishmen,such as Sinn Féin in politics,the Gaelic Athletic Association in sports,and the Gaelic League in cultural affairs.He never tried to understand the unionist forces emerging in Ulster.Redmond was further weakened in 1914 by the formation by Sinn Féin members of the Irish Volunteers.His enthusiastic supportfor the British war effort alienated many Irish nationalists.His party had been increasingly hollowed out,and a major crisis— notably the Easter Rising— was enough to destroy it.",

          "story" : "John Redmond Street is home to some of Cork's most interesting pubs. For example, Pat Buckley's, a renowned and well established landmark pub on the North side of Cork City. It may be one of the smaller pubs in the City, but this family run pub certainly packs a punch well above its weight. Located, only around the corner from the banks of the Lee, the pub is only minutes from Cork Opera House & City Centre and with The Maldron Hotel and Kinlay House almost next door, you couldn’t ask for more!! While the pub enjoys a strong local trade there is many a tourist that frequents here. For the locals, there is “ceol agus craic” and for the tourist, one of Corks finest traditional pubs, and for both……..a pint to remember.Another reputable name on the street is The Maldron Hotel.Interestingly,the Maldron Hotel is partially built on the site where a morgue was once in operation during the epidemic - rife days of 19 th Century Cork.It has also been reported that a man once hung himself in a different incarnation of the building in years gone by.As a result,numerous reports of haunting have been reported in the MaldronTwo of supposedly the 'most haunted rooms',318 and 319,on Halloween night were investigated by a team of Paranormal Investigators.There is a room situated between 318 and 319 that has been mysteriously sealed off,seemingly never to be accessed by neither guests nor staff forevermore.Rumours abound that the sealed - off room faces its current fate as a result of being 'too haunted' to begin with;unfitfor guests 'use following reportings of alleged disturbing paranormal incidences by unfortunate former guests. The team members were unable to report experiencing any bizarre phenomena throughout the 10-hour Halloween vigil that was determinedly upheld.",

          "story" : "Just adjacent to James Redmond Street are the Shandon Bells in St. Anne's.St.Anne’ s has been described as,“the most important ecclesiastical structure of any period,within the the city of Cork and its immediate environs,it is also one of the most important early 18 th century churches in Ireland and one of a small number which still retains their original 18 th century bells” - (2001 Architectural & Archaeological Appraisal– Colin Rynnefor Southgate & Assoc.).Built in 1722 as a chapel of ease to the former St.Mary’ s Church Shandon,which was originally situated on this site,but moved to Shandon Street in 1693,overlooking the North gate bridge after it was destroyed in the Seige of Cork in 1690. In the beginning of the 18 th century the Shandon area emerged as the focal point of the world butter trade.The city itself changed physically at this time,the marshes were reclaimed to create new streets,eg: St.Patricks Street,and the North and South Gate bridges were rebuilt.By 1700 the population was 25,000 by the late 1700 s it had grown to between 56,000 and 80,000. Despite the prosperity of the times an influx of people into the city brought its own problems and poverty was rife.The Tower forms a striking landmark,visible from many parts of the city,with its red sandstone(North & East) and white ashlar limestone(South & West).It is believed that the colours of the tower gave rise to the sporting colours of Cork.The steps of the tower are built into the 7 feet thick walls and climb up past the clocks,through the belfry to the balcony 40 metres above the ground.The tower was raised in height in 1750 to accommodate the eight bells.The McOstrich Family were involved in the creation of the tower and whenever a member of their family marries,the bells are rung in their honour.The bells were cast by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester in 1750,and have been recast twice since in 1869 & 1908. They still bear their original inscriptions,including the following:‘When us you ring we’ ll sweetly sing’‘ Since generosity has opened our mouths our tongues shall sing aloud its praise’The bells weigh over 6 tonnes altogether.The Clock was erected by Cork Corporation in 1847,and given the name‘ the four faced liar’ by local wits who noticed that the four clocks were not always in agreement of the exact time.The machinery of the clocks weigh 2 tonnes and the clock faces are 14 feet in diameter.The maker of the clock was James Mangan,who had a clock shop on St.Patricks St.until the 1980 s when Merchants Quay Shopping Centre was constructed.This was the first four - faced clock,until the construction of Big Ben in London.The fish shaped weather vane known also as‘ de goldie fish’,is over four meters long and painted in gold leaf.It symbolises the salmon fishing industry,which was very important to Cork and also the sign of a fish is very appropriate on a church as the fish is an early christain symbolfor the name of the Lord.Inside the Church of St.Anne’ s some features of interest include a Victorian timber barrel vaulted ceiling,an early 18 th century barley twist communion rail and a baptismal font from the original church of saint Mary’ s,dated 1629. The walls are adorned with memorials to families associated with the church including one commemorating George Benson,a curate of the parish who died in 1832 a victim of the cholera outbreak.Another is dedicated to the Downes family,typical of many Irish families,who have sent their children far and wide.The tablet records the deaths of five sons,in New York,London,The South Seas,Bombay and the Cape of Good Hope.The 1914 - 1918 War memorial is one of the finest of its time and was designed by Caulfield Orpen in Dublin.The church also has five stained glass windows,beautifully colourful and of the highest craftsmanship,including Hubert McGoldrick’ s oval St.Luke’ s window.St.Anne’ s graveyard to the left of the church is the resting place of the Mahony family,including Francis Mahony(Fr.Prout) who penned the famous song‘ The Bells of Shandon’.Francis was the second child of Martin Mahony,son of Timothy Mahony– the founder of the Blarney Woolen Mills.Francis was ordained a priest in 1832 and appointed Chaplin of the North Infirmary(now the Maldron Hotel) and devoted himself to working with the striken during the outbreak of cholera.He eventually left the priesthood to concentrate on writing.The name Fr.Prout comes from the name of a well learned but eccentric priest from Watergrasshill whom Mahony had admired.The graveyard to the right at the bottom of Bob and Joans Walk,is now called Dr.Mary Hearn Park.Dr.Hearn was the wife of Robert T.Hearn a rector of St.Anne’ s from 1905 to 1939. She was known in the areafor her generosity to the poor by way of offering her servicesfor free to those whom she knew could not afford it,and regardless of denomination.Behind St.Anne’ s once stood the Greencoat School,built in 1716for children of poor parents.Boys were taught reading writing and accounts,and girls were taught to knit sew and spin.Two statues,representing students of the school and the uniform of the day,‘Bob & Joan’ once stood at the gates to the Greencoat school,they are now housed in the tower of St.Annes,and look pretty goodfor almost 300 yrs old!Behind Kinlay House is Skiddy’ s Almshouse.Skiddy was a London wine merchant and native of Cork.In his will in 1584 he bequethed a sum of£ 24 per year to the Mayor of Corkfor 10 of the cities’‘ honestest,poorest persons aged 50 + ’to be housed in an Almshouse.",

          "story" : "Set up in October 1833, the sign on the Rotunda Buildings, Oliver Plunkett Street, under the auspices of of the architect Robert Howard, this appears to be the first sign in Cork which features Egyptian lettering. Howard was a major city architect at the time.Oliver Plunkett Street is a key shopping street in Cork,Ireland.It was originally laid - out in the early 18 th century as the city expanded eastwards beyond the original city walls.It was the only street in Ireland on a shortlistfor the 'Great Street Award 2016'by London 's Academy of Urbanism, It subsequently won the award - over nearly seventy other candidates from the UK and Ireland.At the start of the 18 th century,Oliver Plunkett Street was the first street built east of the Grand Parade in the area then known as the East Marsh or Dunscombe Marsh.It was originally named George 's Street after George I, the then reigning King of Great Britain and Ireland.In 1920,during the Burning of Cork,large parts of the street were destroyed by British troops.After the establishment of the Irish Free State,the street was renamed after Oliver Plunkett,a 17 th - century martyr and Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh.The name change was gradual and as late as 1945,business directories still contained a reference to 'Late George's Street '.The street runs in a straight line from Custom House Street to Grand Parade.Between Grand Parade and Parnell Place,the street is a shopping street.With the exception of the secondary entrance to the Penneys department store,most retailers on the street are small standalone retailers.However,there are a number of chain retailers that operate smaller stores too,such as Leonidas and Bewley 's. This section of the street is also home to Cork's main Post Office.A small lane,known as Market Lane,provides access to the English Market.It is also one of a number of nightlife centres in Cork - although there are more bars and restaurants on the neighbouring sidestreets than on Oliver Plunkett Street itself.Between Parnell Place and Custom House Quay,the street is known as Lower Oliver Plunkett Street.",

          "story" : "Oliver Plunkett Street was originally named George's Street after George I, the then reigning King of Great Britain and Ireland.In 1920,during the Burning of Cork,large parts of the street were destroyed by British troops.After the establishment of the Irish Free State,the street was renamed after Oliver Plunkett,a 17 th - century martyr and Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh.Oliver Plunkett was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland who was the last victim of the Popish Plot.He was beatified in 1920 and canonised in 1975,thus becoming the first new Irish saintfor almost seven hundred years.Oliver Plunkett was born on the 1 st of November 1625(earlier biographers gave his date of birth as 1 November 1629, but 1625 has been the consensus since the 1930 s) in Loughcrew,County Meath,Ireland,to well - to - do parents with Hiberno - Norman ancestors.He was related by birth to a number of landed families,such as the recently ennobled Earls of Roscommon,as well as the long - established Earls of Fingall,Lords Louth and Lords Dunsany.Until his sixteenth year,the boy 's education was entrusted to his cousin Patrick Plunkett, Abbot of St Mary's,Dublin and brother of Luke Plunkett,the first Earl of Fingall,who later became successively Bishop of Ardagh and of Meath.As an aspirant to the priesthood heset outfor Rome in 1647,under the care of Father Pierfrancesco Scarampi of the Roman Oratory.At this time the Irish Confederate Wars were raging in Ireland;these were essentially conflicts between native Irish Roman Catholics,English and Irish Anglicans and Protestants.Scarampi was the Papal envoy to the Roman Catholic movement known as the Confederation of Ireland.Many of Plunkett 's relatives were involved in this organisation.He was admitted to the Irish College in Rome and proved to be an able pupil.He was ordained a priest in 1654,and deputed by the Irish bishops to act as their representative in Rome.Meanwhile,the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland(1649– 53) had defeated the Roman Catholic cause in Ireland; in the aftermath the public practice of Roman Catholicism was banned and Roman Catholic clergy were executed.As a result,it was impossiblefor Plunkett toreturn to Irelandfor many years.He petitioned to remain in Rome and,in 1657,became a professor of theology.Throughout the period of the Commonwealth and the first years of Charles II 's reign, he successfully pleaded the cause of the Irish Roman Church, and also served as theological professor at the College of Propaganda Fide. At the Congregation of Propaganda Fide on 9 July 1669 he was appointed Archbishop of Armagh, the Irish primatial see, and was consecrated on 30 November at Ghent by the Bishop of Ghent, Eugeen-Albert, count d'Allamont.He eventuallyset foot on Irish soil again on 7 March 1670,as the English Restoration of 1660 had begun on a basis of toleration.The pallium was granted him in the Consistory of 28 July 1670.After arriving back in Ireland,he tackled drunkenness among the clergy,writing: 'Let us remove this defect from an Irish priest,and he will be a saint'.The Penal Laws had been relaxed in line with the Declaration of Breda in 1660 and he was able to establish a Jesuit College in Drogheda in 1670. A year later 150 students attended the college,no fewer than 40 of whom were Protestant,making this college the first integrated school in Ireland.His ministry was a successful one and he is said to have confirmed 48,000 Catholics over a 4 - year period.The government in Dublin,especially under the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,the Duke of Ormonde(the Protestant son of Catholic parents) extended a generous measure of toleration to the Catholic hierarchy until the mid - 1670 s.On the enactment of the Test Act in 1673,to which Plunkett would not agreefor doctrinal reasons,the college was closed and demolished.Plunkett went into hiding,travelling only in disguise,and refused a government edict to register at a seaport to await passage into exile.For the next few years he was largely left in peace since the Dublin government,except when put under pressure from the English government in London,preferred to leave the Catholic bishops alone.In 1678 the so - called Popish Plot,concocted in England by clergyman Titus Oates,led to further anti - Roman Catholic action.Archbishop Peter Talbot of Dublin was arrested,and Plunkett again went into hiding.The Privy Council in London was told that Plunkett had plotted a French invasion.The moving spirit behind the campaign is said to have been Arthur Capell,the first Earl of Essex,who had been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and hoped to resume the office by discrediting the Duke of Ormonde.However Essex was not a ruthless or unprincipled man and his later pleafor mercy suggests that he had never intended that Plunkett should actually die.Despite being on the run and with a price on his head,Plunkett refused to leave his flock.At some point before his final incarceration,he took refuge in a church that once stood in the townland of Killartry,in the parish of Clogherhead in County Louth,seven miles outside Drogheda.He was arrested in Dublin in December 1679 and imprisoned in Dublin Castle,where he gave absolution to the dying Talbot.Plunkett was tried at Dundalkfor conspiring against the state by allegedly plotting to bring 20,000 French soldiers into the country,andfor levying a tax on his clergy to support 70,000 menfor rebellion.Though this was unproven,some in government circles were worried about the possibility that a repetition of the Irish rebellion of 1641 was being planned and in anycase this was a convenient excusefor proceeding against Plunkett.Lord Ormonde,aware that Lord Essex was using the crisis to undermine him,did not defend Plunkett in public.In private however he made clear his belief in Plunkett 's innocence and his contempt for the informers against him: 'silly drunken vagabonds... whom no schoolboy would trust to rob an orchard'.Plunkett did not object to facing an all - Protestant jury,but the trial soon collapsed as the prosecution witnesses were themselves wanted men and afraid to turn up in court.Lord Shaftesbury knew Plunkett would never be convicted in Ireland,irrespective of the jury 's composition, and so had Plunkett moved to Newgate Prison in London in order to face trial at Westminster Hall. The first grand jury found no true bill, but he was not released. The second trial has generally been regarded as a serious miscarriage of justice; Plunkett was denied defending counsel (although Hugh Reily acted as his legal advisor) and time to assemble his defence witnesses, and he was also frustrated in his attempts to obtain the criminal records of those who were to give evidence against him. His servant James McKenna, and a relative, John Plunkett, had travelled back to Ireland and failed within the time available to bring back witnesses and evidence for the defence. During the trial, Archbishop Plunkett had disputed the right of the court to try him in England and he also drew attention to the criminal past of the witnesses, but to no avail. Lord Chief Justice Sir Francis Pemberton addressing these complaints said to Plunkett: 'Look you, Mr. Plunket, it is in vain for you to talk and make this discourse here now...' and later on again: 'Look you, Mr. Plunket, don't mis - spend your own time;for the more you trifle in these things,the less time you will havefor your defence'.The Scottish clergyman and future Bishop of Salisbury,Gilbert Burnet,an eyewitness,had no doubt of the innocence of Plunkett,whom he praised as a wise and sober man who wished only to live peacefully and tend to his congregation.Writing in the 19 th century,Lord Campbell said of the judge,Pemberton,that the trial was a disgrace to himself and his country.More recently the High Court judge Sir James Comyn called it a grave mistake:while Plunkett,by virtue of his office,was clearly guilty of 'promoting the Catholic faith',and may possibly have had some dealings with the French,there was never the slightest evidence that he had conspired against the King 's life.Archbishop Plunkett was found guilty of high treason in June 1681 'for promoting the Roman faith',and was condemned to death.In passing judgement,the Chief Justice said: 'You have done as much as you could to dishonour God in thiscase;for the bottom of your treason was your setting up your false religion,than which there is not any thing more displeasing to God,or more pernicious to mankind in the world'.The jury returned within fifteen minutes with a guilty verdict and Archbishop Plunkett replied:'Deo Gratias' (Latinfor 'Thanks be to God').Numerous pleasfor mercy were made but Charles II,although himself a reputed crypto - Catholic,thought it too politically dangerous to spare Plunkett.The French ambassador to England,Paul Barillon,conveyed a pleafor mercy from his king,Louis XIV.Charles said frankly that he knew Plunkett to be innocent,but that the time was not right to take so bold a step as to pardon him.Lord Essex,apparently realising too late that his intrigues had led to the condemnation of an innocent man,made a similar pleafor mercy.The King,normally the most self - controlled of men,turned on Essex in fury,saying: 'his blood be on your head - you could have saved him but would not,I would save him and dare not'.Plunkett was hanged,drawn and quartered at Tyburn on 1 July 1681,aged 55,the last Roman Catholic martyr to die in England.[13] His body was initially buried in two tin boxes,next to five Jesuits who had died previously,in the courtyard of St Giles in the Fields church.The remains were exhumed in 1683 and moved to the Benedictine monastery at Lamspringe,near Hildesheim in Germany.The head was brought to Rome,and from there to Armagh,and eventually to Drogheda where since 29 June 1921 it has rested in Saint Peter 's Church. Most of the body was brought to Downside Abbey, England, where the major part is located today, with some parts remaining at Lamspringe. Some relics were brought to Ireland in May 1975, while others are in England, France, Germany, the United States, and Australia.Oliver Plunkett was beatified in 1920 and canonised in 1975,the first new Irish saintfor almost seven hundred years,and the first of the Irish martyrs to be beatified.For the canonisation,the customary second miracle was waived.He has since been followed by 17 other Irish martyrs who were beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1992. Among them were Archbishop Dermot O 'Hurley, Margaret Ball, and the Wexford Martyrs.As a spectacle alone,the rally and Massfor St Oliver Plunkett on London 's Clapham Common was a remarkable triumph. As the Common was invaded for a celebration of the 300th anniversary of Plunkett's martyrdom,Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich,twenty enrobed bishops and a number of abbots stood on a stage beneath a scaffolding shelter on 1 July 1981. Ó Fiaich had flown there in a helicopter with Plunkett’ s body.This occasion attracted thousands of pilgrims to the park.In 1997 Plunkett was made a patron saintfor peace and reconciliation in Ireland,adopted by the prayer group campaigningfor peace in Ireland,'St.Oliver Plunkettfor Peace and Reconciliation'.",

          "story" : "William Rory Gallagher was an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader. Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the 1970s and 1980s, after forming the band Taste during the late 1960s. He was a talented guitarist known for his charismatic performances and dedication to his craft. Gallagher's albums have sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide. Gallagher received a liver transplant in 1995, but died of complications later that year in London, UK at the age of 47.Gallagher grew up in a time of religious upheaval.On one side you had the Catholic Church and the general conservatism that often goes with a fairly traditional culture;on the other,a new dynamism that plugged into events that were happening all around the world.The emergence of The Beatles by 1963 had fanned the flames of a new international youth culture that had been born in the 1950 s.Rory Gallagher and his younger brother Donal had been first exposed to this as young children in Derry,the hometown of their father Daniel,where the family lived until 1956.The American naval base in Derry had its own radio station,and its strong signal ensured the Gallagher household got to hear US tunes of many different genres.Northern Ireland also had television before the South,and Donal Gallagher remembers a regular stroll with his brother at 6 pm to the Diamond area of Derry city centre,where a shop had a demo version of this incredible new technology.They’ d push their way to the front of the regular crowd who gathered there,and stare through the shop window at the BBC’ s very first pop show,Six - Five Special.The fact that they couldn’ t hear anything didn’ t matter to young Rory.“He already knew the lyrics to loads of the songs,”remembers Donal.“So,he’ d unconsciously sing out loud as the bands were playing on screen,and provide great entertainmentfor the other people gathered there.”So,by the time Rory moved to Cork in 1956 at the age of eight,a combination of those Derry influences and growing up in a household where both parents loved music,ensured the seeds of his future career were well and truly planted.Passionfor music is one thing,but even in his childhood years Rory had the self - discipline to spend hours practising on his acoustic guitar.The Derry accent now replaced by a Leeside brogue,he’ d enter talent competitions around the city and his big‘ breakthrough’ came when he won an event at Cork City Hall around 1960. In what was the first of his many encounters with the media,a delighted 12 - year - old came into the offices of the Cork Examiner and Evening Echo on Academy Street to proudly posefor a picture holding his guitar on the roof of the building(see above).As Gallagher entered his teens,the winds of change were blowing that bit stronger through the city.The economy was improving and emigration also began to slow,allowing more young people to stay and provide essential lifebloodfor their home towns.Of course,for Ireland,one of the few silver linings to come out of emigration has been the cultural links it fosters to the outside world.An incredible 15 % of the population had left the country in the 1950 s and,while they left heartbroken families behind,their experiences in the big cities of Britain and the US would makefor great reading in the letters home.Rory and Donal had already experienced this when a family friend,Bill Mellerick,had secured Bill Hailey’ s autograph as rewardfor helping the rock’ n’ roll superstar escape a mob of fans outside the hotel where the Corkman worked in Britain.He sent the autograph to the Gallaghers and it became a prized possession.Returning emigrants also brought home their record collections,some of which would end up in the second - hand bookshops around Cork.Rory’ s first album was The Buddy Holly Story,purchased from a bookshop on Shandon Street.While the showbands in Ireland had thrivedfor many years,the emergence of the new wave of British bands from 1963 onwards had spawned a rival‘ beat’ scene in this country.It was a movement Gallagher identified with.He had bought his famous Stratocaster guitar in Crowleys on Merchants Quay in 1963,butfor the moment it was the showbands that provided the best outlet to hone his skills as a musician.Even that relatively benign circuit didn’ t meet with the approval of the forces of old Ireland.When word eventually reached the North Mon school that Gallagher was in The Fontana band,a Christian Brother teacher felt it was enough of an affront to administer quite a severe beating to the teenager.He left to go to the more liberal St Kieran’ s college on Camden Quay.While he might not have horns on his head like that apocryphal dancer in the Arcadia,Rory Gallagher did have the longest hair in Cork.Maybe even in Ireland.Donal remembers occasional adults and teenagers alike shouting abuse as the duo walked through the city.“I’ dget boiling mad,butif I hit somebody a belt,Rory wouldget so angry with me,”says Donal.Rory’ s hair also caused an issue in 1965 when his band got a residency at a US airforce base in Spain.He had to cut those beloved locks to even be allowed into a country that was ruled by dictator General Franco.By this time,the music scene had already been developing in Cork.An early venue on MacCurtain Street was created when one of the Gallaghers’ friends got the keys to the army social club.It became the location of an informal club called The Crypt,complete with a borrowed coffin in front of the stage.It was all innocent stuff,more youth club than anything commercial— people playing informal jam sessions in a room with no bar— but it soon to the attention of Official Ireland.A garda raid brought the fun to an end and the coffin was despatched in a taxi back to its owners,Fordes’ funeral home.Every youth scene in Cork through the decades has had its crystallising moments– from the Sweat nights and Nirvana gig at Sir Henry’ s in the 1990 s,to the Specials at the Arcadia in the early 80 s,and even Gallagher himself at City Hall in the 1970 s.For the youngsters of that mid - 60 s generation,the‘ I was there moment’ came in 1965 with the visit by the Rolling Stones to the Savoy,with Rory savingfor weeks to buy a ticket.He was left slightly miffed,however,when his brother was left in the stage door by members of the band.Soon afterwards,Donal got involved with dental student Robin Power in a club in Youghal,also named The Crypt,located above the Strand Palace Hotel.They booked some of the growing number of touring beat groups and it was a very successful summer venture,with the local crowd being boosted by organised buses from Cork and and an influx of continental students in the town to learn English.Though they probably didn’ t realise it at the time,the talented crop of young people involved in this new culture were doing something quite revolutionary.Not wanting t to go to the pub or hang out at the same places as their parents,they just created their own scene.Donal ended up as a DJ in a new club on Leitrim Street in Cork.A labyrinth of a building,the walls of the former factory were daubed with luminous - paint slogans to up the cool factor.Cateringfor a mostly 15 - to - 17 - year - old age group,The Cavern had a mineral bar,and a conspicuous absence of anything stronger.“Though I do remember some lads buying herbal cigarettes in the chemist and pretending they were high,just to look cool,”says Donal.And like all true scenesters,there was a clear identification of being different than the people who spilled from the city’ s other venues.Even the showband scene was sniffed at.“The Dixies and some of the others thought of themselves as real rock’ n’ rollers.They must have thought we were real little shits,”says Donal with a laugh.The few photographs that remain from the time indicate a crowd who were bang on trend in terms of fashion and haircuts.“The girls,in particular,would be very well turned out,”remembers Donal.“They’ d see the fashions in magazines like Jackie and Fab,and evenif they couldn’ t afford or find stuff,in those days people often made clothesfor themselves.”Females at The Cavern were protected somewhat by the new,more progressive culture that was emerging.Ensuring nobody broke the rules or got past the door with alcohol taken was well - known bouncer Hughie O’ Flynn.A corporation worker by day,he donned a silk suit and diamond cufflinks to work the Cavern door at night.On a few occasions,irate fathers showed up lookingfor their daughters,fearful they were hanging out in some den of iniquity with a bunch of beatniks.“They’ d be invited inside,offered a bottle of lemonade at the bar and shown around.”Generally,the fathers would leave assuaged.They’ d have seen a bunch of well - behaved kids sitting around chatting and sipping their minerals,or dancing to the live bands and DJs.While music equipment was fairly rudimentary back then,Donalset up a primitive precursor to the fancy mixers in use today.Basically,it involved two record players rigged up inside a box from Harrington’ s bakery.Donal would often play records in breaks between bands,which in 1966 included several gigs from his brother’ s newly - formed group,The Taste.This three - piece was a major step on the road to stardomfor Rory.They worked on their performances at various other venues in Cork,and even got to play their own brand of the devil’ s music at the Arcadia.Things would never be the same again.",

          "story" : "William Rory Gallagher was an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader. Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the 1970s and 1980s, after forming the band Taste during the late 1960s. He was a talented guitarist known for his charismatic performances and dedication to his craft. Gallagher's albums have sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide. Gallagher received a liver transplant in 1995, but died of complications later that year in London, UK at the age of 47.Having completed a musical apprenticeship in the showbands,and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early 1960 s,Gallagher formed 'The Taste',which was later renamed simply,'Taste',a blues rock and R & B power trio,in 1966. Initially,the band was composed of Gallagher and two Cork musicians,Norman Damery and Eric Kitteringham(died 2013),however,by 1968,they were replaced with two musicians from Belfast,featuring Gallagher on guitar and vocals,drummer John Wilson,and bassist Richard McCracken.Performing extensively in the UK,the group played regularly at the Marquee Club,supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert,and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.Managed by Eddie Kennedy,the trio released the albums Taste and On The Boards,and two live recordings,Live Taste and Live at the Isle of Wight.[15] The latter appeared long after the band 's break-up shortly after their appearance at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival.After thebreak -up of Taste,Gallagher toured under his own name,hiring former Deep Joy bass player Gerry McAvoy to play on Gallagher 's self-titled debut album, Rory Gallagher.It was the beginning of a twenty - year musical relationship between Gallagher and McAvoy;the other band member was drummer Wilgar Campbell.[15] The 1970 s were Gallagher 's most prolific period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour '74. November 1971 saw the release of the album Deuce.[17] In the same year he was voted Melody Maker 's International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. However, despite a number of his albums from this period reaching the UK Albums Chart, Gallagher did not attain major star status.Gallagher played and recorded what he said was  'in me all the time,and not just something I turn on....Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide,it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim.He is documented in Irish Tour '74, a film directed by Tony Palmer. During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.He himself admitted in several interviews that at first there were not any international Irish acts until Van Morrison,Gallagher,and later,Phil Lynott and Thin Lizzy grew popular during the 1970 s.The line - up which included Rod de 'Ath on drums and Lou Martin on keyboards, performed together between 1973 and 1976. However, he eventually dropped down to just bass, guitar and drums, and his act became a power trio. Other releases from that period include Against the Grain, Calling Card, Photo-Finish, and Top Priority. Gerry McAvoy has stated that the Gallagher band performed several TV and radio shows across Europe, including Beat-Club in Bremen, Germany and the Old Grey Whistle Test. He recorded two 'Peel Sessions' (both February 1973 and containing the same tracks), but only the first was broadcast.[20] Along with Little Feat and Roger McGuinn, Gallagher performed the first Rockpalast live concert at the Grugahalle, Essen, Germany in 1977.Gallagher collaborated with Jerry Lee Lewis and Muddy Waters[on their respective London Sessions in the mid - 1970 s.He played on Lonnie Donegan 's final album. He was David Coverdale's second choice(after Jeff Beck) to replace Ritchie Blackmore in Deep Purple.Gallagher chose to perform in his own band.In the 1980 s he continued recording, producing Jinx, Defender, and Fresh Evidence.After Fresh Evidence, he embarked on a tour of the United States.In addition he played with Box of Frogs— a band formed in 1983 by former members of The Yardbirds.Becoming obsessive over details and plagued by self - doubt, Gallagher nevertheless retained a loyal fanbase.During this period he stated 'I agonize too much'.Notes From San Francisco, an album of unreleased studio tracks and a San Francisco 1979 concert, was released in May 2011.",

          "story" : "Terence James was an Irish playwright, author and politician. He was elected as Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Cork during the Irish War of Independence in 1920. He was arrested by the British on charges of sedition and imprisoned in Brixton Prison in England. His death there in October 1920 after 74 days on hunger strike brought him and the Irish struggle to international attention.MacSwiney was one of eight children.His father,John MacSwiney,of Cork,had volunteered in 1868 to fight as a papal guard against Garibaldi,had been a schoolteacher in London and later opened a tobacco factory in Cork.Following the failure of this business,he emigrated to Australia in 1885 leaving Terence and the other children in the care of their mother and his eldest daughter.[2] MacSwiney 's mother, Mary Wilkinson, was an English Catholic with strong Irish nationalist opinions. He was born at 23 North Main Street, Cork. He was educated by the Christian Brothers at the North Monastery school in Cork city, but left at fifteen to help support the family.[3] He became an accountancy clerk but continued his studies and matriculated successfully. He continued in full-time employment while he studied at the Royal University (now University College Cork), graduating with a degree in Mental and Moral Science in 1907.In 1901 he helped to found the Celtic Literary Society,and in 1908 he founded the Cork Dramatic Society with Daniel Corkery and wrote a number of playsfor them.He was educated as an accountant and also was a playwright,poet,and writer of pamphlets on Irish history.His first play The Last Warriors of Coole was produced in 1910. His fifth play The Revolutionist(1915) took the political stand made by a single man as its theme.Described as a sensitive poet - intellectual,MacSwiney 's writings in the newspaper Irish Freedom brought him to the attention of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He was one of the founders of the Cork Brigade of the Irish Volunteers in 1913, and was President of the Cork branch of Sinn Féin. He founded a newspaper, Fianna Fáil, in 1914, but it was suppressed after only 11 issues. In April 1916, he was intended to be second in command of the Easter Rising in Cork and Kerry, but stood down his forces on the order of Eoin MacNeill. Following the rising, he was interned under the Defence of the Realm Act in Reading and Wakefield Gaols until December 1916. In February 1917 he was deported from Ireland and interned in Shrewsbury and Bromyard internment camps until his release in June 1917. It was during his exile in Bromyard that he married Muriel Murphy of the Cork distillery-owning family. In November 1917, he was arrested in Cork for wearing an Irish Republican Army (IRA) uniform, and, inspired by the example of Thomas Ashe, went on a hunger strike for three days prior to his release.[8]In the 1918 general election,MacSwiney was returned unopposed to the first Dáil Éireann as Sinn Féin representativefor Mid Cork,succeeding the Nationalist MP D.D.Sheehan.After the murder of his friend Tomás Mac Curtain,the Lord Mayor of Cork on 20 March 1920,MacSwiney was elected as Lord Mayor.On 12 August 1920,he was arrested in Corkfor possession of seditious articles and documents,and also possession of a cipher key.He was summarily tried by court martial on 16 August and sentenced to two years ' imprisonment in Brixton Prison.In prison he immediately started a hunger strike in protest at his internment and the fact that he was tried by a military court.Eleven republican prisoners in Cork Jail went on hunger strike at the same time.On 26 August,the British cabinet stated that 'the release of the Lord Mayor would have disastrous results in Ireland and would probably lead to a mutiny of both military and police in south of Ireland.'MacSwiney's hunger strike gained world attention. The British government was threatened with a boycott of British goods by Americans, while four countries in South America appealed to the Pope to intervene. Protests were held in Germany and France as well. An Australian member of Parliament, Hugh Mahon, was expelled from the Australian parliament for 'seditious and disloyal utterances at a public meeting' after protesting against the actions of the British Government. Two weeks later, the Catalan organization Autonomous Center of Employees of Commerce and Industry (CADCI) sent a petition to British Prime Minister calling for his release and the newspaper of the organization, Acció, began a campaign for MacSwiney.Food was often placed near him to persude him to give up the hunger - strike.Attempts at force - feeding MacSwiney were undertaken in the final days of his strike.On 20 October 1920,he fell into a coma and died five days later after 73 days on hunger strike.His body lay in St George 's Cathedral, Southwark in London where 30,000 people filed past it. Fearing large-scale demonstrations in Dublin, the authorities diverted his coffin directly to Cork and his funeral there on 31 October attracted huge crowds. Terence MacSwiney is buried in the Republican plot in Saint Finbarr's Cemetery in Cork.Arthur Griffith delivered the graveside oration.",

The foundation stone was laid by Eamonn de Valera, president of the Executive Council of the State on 9th July, 1932. The first meeting of the Council was held on 24th April, 1935 and the building was formerly opened by Eamonn de Valera on 8th September 1936.The building is designed on classic lines to harmonise with the examples of eighteenth and nineteenth century architecture,fundamentally Georgian in character,that so richly endow Cork City.The main entrance to the offices is from Anglesea Street through a marble paved vestibule to the main staircase hall.The City Hall contains works by Seamus Murphy,R.H.A.,which includes busts of Lord Mayors Tomas MacCurtain and Terence MacSwiney and a profile of the late US President John F.Kennedy erected over the main entrance door commemorating his visit to Cork in 1963.

          "story" : "Evergreen Road is within the area of Cork known as Turner’s Cross. Turners Cross is a ward on the south side of Cork City, and home to the Roman Catholic parish of the same name.Largely residential,one of the key features of the area is the iconic church created by architectBarry Byrne and sculptor John Storrs,the Church of Christ The King.It was commissioned in 1927 by Rev Daniel Cohalan D.D.,Bishop of Cork.The church was the first Irish church to be built from concrete instead of brick,and is one of the largest suspended - ceiling churches in Europe.Opened in 1931,the church is based on the principles of Art Deco which makes strong use of symmetric and geometric forms.Rocque 's map of Cork of 1759 is the first to show significant housing in the Turners Cross area in the areas that are now Evergreen St (then Maypole Lane) and Quaker Rd (then Graveyard Lane).[2] Previous maps of Cork in 1690 and 1726 show only occasional houses associated with what were then farms on the southern edge of Cork City. The oldest housing still existing in Turners Cross now dates from the mid 19th century.In 1879,the Cork and Macroom Direct Railway,which had shared the Cork,Bandon and South Coast Railway station at Albert Road in the city centre,moved its city terminus to a new station they created - Cork Capwell railway station in the Turners Cross area.This was used until 1925,when both the Cork and Macroom and Cork,Bandon and South Coast railways were merged into Great Southern Railways and the terminus reverted to Albert Road.New housing was continually developed in the Turners Cross area until the 1950 s,when there was little remaining spare land in the area.Turners Cross is home to Cork City FC which is based in the Turners Cross Stadium.Nearby there is also a rugby stadium,Musgrave Park,which is home to both Dolphin RFC and Sundays Well RFC.In addition,Musgrave Park is usedfor many home matches in the Pro 12 tournament by Munster Rugby.The local GAA club is Nemo Rangers,although they sold their grounds in Turners Crossfor housing and relocated to a new location in Douglas during the Celtic Tiger era.The main primary school in the area is Bunscoil Chríost Rí,which is a Catholic mixed(co - educational) school.The secondary schools in the area are Christ King,a girls only school,and Coláiste Chríost Rí,a boys school.",

          "story" : "The Church Of Christ The King on Evergreen Road was commissioned in 1927 by RevDaniel Cohalan D.D.,Bishop of Cork.By the mid 1920’ s,the South Parish of Cork city,had grown in both population and area to a point where it could no longerfunction with a single church.In an effort to address the situation,the bishop of Cork,Rev.Daniel Cohalan D.D designated Turners Cross as the locationfor a second parish church to serve the ever growing congregation.According to the Cork Examiner article on Monday 26 th October,1931,“Christ - King New Church Turners Cross”,Dr.Cohalan was quoted as having originally decided on a more standard design from Irish & U.K.architects but the cost had proved“ well nigh prohibitive”.It was the result of reading an article by Barry Byrne that his lordship’ s attention was caught.By the late 20’ s Byrne,a former student of Frank Lloyd Wright,had already designed three Catholic churches in the US,all of which received acclaim and criticismfor their bold and innovative designs.He was also well known among the Catholic clergyfor regular contributions on church design to publications such as Commonweal.Looking back at the 1920’ s in Ireland,the society and Catholic church would today be regarded as inward looking and very traditional.The idea of a futuristic design by a foreign architect would alone have fueled strong opposition toward Dr.Cohalan.This,as it turned out was only the start of many problems to come.The first model of the Turners Cross church,was based on a brick exterior / interior and featured a suspended wooden ceiling.It was a development on a previous Byrne design in Tulsa,Oklahoma(1926) and also represented the more economic of solutions typically used in the US.However this design was subject to an overall cost restriction of£ 30,000 with£ 20,000 allocatedfor the building and the remaining£ 10,000 keptfor the inner furnishings.After some investigation,site supervising architect J.R.Boyd Barrett reported that a brick and wood building could not be accomplished on a£ 20,000 budget and suggested that a complete concrete construction with plaster ceiling would be more realistic.Although somewhat reluctant to sacrifice the brick and wood design,Byrne reworked his solution to use concrete as the main construction material.The result would involve the use of large sections of molded concrete re - enforcedfor strength.Decorative features around doors and windows would all be made from cast stone.Basically,the stone mason was not a consideration.The reissued model,depicted a new departure in Byrnes style and the Church of Christ the King,became the first Irish church ever built from concrete.The innovative design and its use of concrete,was very likely the first large - scale application of re - enforced concrete construction in Ireland.We must remember that ready - mix cement was unheard of at the time.It was a complete shake - up of the building industry in Ireland.Prior to construction,Barry Byrne and his wife,Annette Cremin Byrne visited Cork to view the site and meet with Dr.Coholan to discuss the final details of the project.Work began in March 1929 with foundations being blessed on 21 st July of the same year by Dr.Cohalan.Initial problems were mostly in relation to the foundation.The soft marsh - like terrain of the site was no matchfor the heavy foundation.Before any walls could be erected,the building contractor,John Buckley,had to sink foundations some fifteen feet to reach a solid base,well above the 5 - 6 feet estimations of Byrne.Other issues included a strong opposition from the Society of Stone Cutters and Marble Masons.Their anger related to the selection of concrete as a base material and instructed that the foundation stone“..shall not be worked,as the building of the said Church is detrimental to our trade”A general building trade strike took place the following year from May to August causing significant delays in the project.The church did however open on time on the Feast of Christ the King,October 25 th 1931. The selection of this date was likely to have been influenced by the previous Byrne church of Christ the King,Tulsa OK.It too was consecrated on the feast day of the same name.However a hasty completion is evident;some of the photographs indicate missing Terrazzo panels on the altar reredos.The Stations of the Cross were also unfurnished and an external fence was not erectedfor some time.On completion,the church never provoked much admiration or criticism.Ireland was however,awoken to the Art Deco movement in architecture.In years to follow,many buildings depicting the styles of Lloyd Wright and others would emerge in Ireland.Oddly enough,the church construction practices in the UK & Ireland would largely ignore these new styles.However the choice of concrete as a raw material,would prove to be a major influence.Such was his delight with the results,Barry Byrne would never again choose brick as his preferred material.His later churches would perfect the use of concrete,not only as a more versatile material,but as a cheap alternative to brick.Other than the pre - construction visit to Cork,Barry Byrne never saw the finished building in person and it remains the only church of his where he did not personally supervise the construction.In 1957,Turners Cross was designated an independent parish by Bishop Cornelius Lucey.This coincided with the construction of five new churches under the direction of Bishop Lucey.Among these was a churchfor the newly formed parish of Ballyphehane.With the large South Parish now segmented,the Church of Christ the King would never again serve the huge massesfor which it was commissioned.However its design excellence and craftsmanship would stand the test of time.Today the church retains most of its original character and layout.Several Irish architecture publications feature this church and on an international scale,the only two Cork churches to frequently feature in journals and books are the Church of Christ the King and the Protestant Cathedral of St.Finbarr.The commission and construction of this church met with strong opposition and its opening was received with little or no appreciation.Howeverif the people of Cork or Turners Crossfor that matter,can be accused of under - appreciating such an architectural gem,then they have certainly made upfor it in recent times with a renovation project costing several million Euro.Fittings ContractsThe original tender as submitted by the building contractor,John Buckley wasfor£ 20,000. Costs relating to the internal furnishings including seats and marble,Terrazzo and other fittings,amounted to£ 7000 with the total cost at£ 27,000. A significant contribution of£ 10,000 from the Geary family foundation provided much needed cash to pay off the construction debts.Local sculptor,John Maguire was contracted to build the large sculpture of Christ the King that stands over the entrance.The statue was designed by American sculptor John Storrs and the final work was based on plaster models shipped from Storrs home in France to Cork.Maguire also worked on the marble altars and gold mosaics.Heating was furnished by C.McCarthy & Sons,Emmett Place,Cork.Eustace & Co of Cork provided all wooden seating and also held the contract as supplierfor the concrete used(1200 tons of“ Condor” brand of Portland cement, treated with“ Pudlow” a brand of waterproofing material commonly used at the time).Marble terrazzo work was carried out by J.J O’ Hara & Co.Dublin..this included the black floor surface and lower wall,beige dado rail and all white marble surfaces used to form the sanctuary and reredos.The Terrazzo work was the first of its’ kind carried out in Ireland.Piggot & Co .117 Patrick Street furnished the Mannborg Model 40 organ fitted in the concealed choir gallery.The General Electric Co.Ltd.,74 Grand Parade,Cork provided the Osram lamps used in the overhead and side lighting.Electrical contractors were S.Nolan & Bros.,87 South Mall Cork who were responsiblefor all wiring and the fitting of Holophane prismatic reflectors designed to provide even light dispersal through the ceiling apex.W.M.Egan & Sons Ltd.,31 - 32 Patrick Street Cork,furnished the brass sanctuary lamp,monstrance and Benediction cope and veil.Egans also furnished the Stations of the Cross.Both sanctuary lamp and stations were made to the architects specifications.Glazing & painting work was carried out by J.F.O’ Mahony of Cork.The bell was supplied by Gillett & Johnston Ltd.,Croydon,Surrey well knownfor their excellence in carillon design.",

          "story" : "Turner’s Cross Stadium is an all-seater football stadium located in and synonymous with the district of Turners Cross in Cork, Ireland. It is home to the Munster Football Association,[4] and League of Ireland side Cork City.It was the first all - seated,all - covered stadium in Ireland following redevelopment in 2009,and it is currently one out of only two,the other being the new Aviva Stadium.Cork City play their home games in the stadium.It also sees a large volume of matches every year including local,regional,national,and international matches and cup finals at schoolboy,junior,intermediate,senior,and underage international level.For many years Turners Cross was little more than a pitch with a few grassy banks and a covered terrace euphemistically called 'The Shed'.However,since the early 2000 s,the stadium was redeveloped to become the only all covered,all seated League of Ireland stadium.As of 2015,the configuration of the stadium includes the 1,857 seater covered 'Donie Forde' stand– which holds the stadium control box,press broadcasting area,and the family section.This is faced by the 1,128 seater covered 'Derrynane Road' stand.At the western end of the ground is the covered St.Anne 's Stand which has a capacity of 2,720. The newest stand is at the eastern end, on a site previously occupied by 'The Shed' covered terracing and a club shop. 'The Shed' previously held over 2,500 supporters and was home to Cork City F.C.'s more vocal fans.This newly developed section seats 1,660 and was opened in March 2007.While known locally and amongst fans as 'The Cross',the ground has also been nicknamed 'The Box' in the past.This accountsfor the title of Plunkett Carter 's book on Cork soccer, From The Lodge to The Box, where 'the lodge ' refers to 'Flower Lodge '. Flower Lodge was originally owned by the Ancient Order of Hibernians and was the previous home of Cork soccer. This ground was subsequently sold to the Gaelic Athletic Association, and renamed Páirc Uí Rinn, for Christy Ring, a noted County Cork hurler.Cork Constitution,then a rugby and cricket club,was the first club to lease the Turners Cross grounds in 1897.(A once popular trivia question was 'Which President of Ireland scored a penalty at Turner's Cross?' The answer is Éamon de Valera (1882–1975) who in his early years played rugby for Rockwell. The penalty in question was during a Rockwell vs Cork Constitution rugby match in the Munster Cup.)Turners Cross was home groundfor the local GAA club Nemo Rangers in the 1930 s.In June 1940 the FAI negotiated a 98 - year lease on Turners Cross with owner Helena O 'Sullivan.In 1977, then League of Ireland side Cork Celtic lookedfor a longer lease on the ground only to be refused by the FAI who were unable to find the property owner.The ground passed into the hands of the Munster Football Association in the 1980 s.Turners Cross has hosted a small number of men 's senior internationals, including a friendly between the national team and Belarus in May 2016, and a 'B' team fixture against England in 1990. Elsewhere in Cork, Flower Lodge hosted a full international on 26 May 1985 between Ireland and Spain, while The Mardyke hosted Ireland vs Hungary in 1939.The stadium has also hosted eight Republic of Ireland under-21 national football team games and other international underage games – including games in the 1994 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship.Soccer, rugby, Gaelic games, boxing and gymkhana events have been held at Turners Cross over the years.",

The university is located in Cork.The university was founded in 1845 as one of three Queen’ s Colleges located in Belfast,Cork,and Galway. It became University College,Cork,under the Irish Universities Act of 1908. The Universities Act 1997 renamed the university as National University of Ireland,Cork,and a Ministerial Order of 1998 renamed the university as University College Cork– National University of Ireland,Cork,though it continues to be almost universally known as University College Cork.Amongst other rankings and awards,the university was named Irish University of the Year by the Sunday Times on five occasions;most recently in 2017. In 2015,UCC was also named as top performing university by the European Commission funded U - Multirank system,based on obtaining the highest number of 'A' scores(21 out of 28 metrics) among a field of 1200 partaking universities.[8] UCC also became the first university to achieve the ISO 50001 standard in energy management in 2011.Queen 's College, Cork, was founded by the provisions of an act which enabled Queen Victoria to endow new colleges for the 'Advancement of Learning in Ireland'. Under the powers of this act, the three colleges of Belfast, Cork and Galway were incorporated on 30 December 1845. The college opened in 1849 with 23 professors and 181 students and a year later became part of the Queen's University of Ireland.The original site chosenfor the college was appropriate in that it is believed to have had a connection with the patron saint of Cork,Saint Finbarr.His monastery and school of learning were close by at Gill Abbey Rock and the mill attached to the monastery is thought to have stood on the bank of the south channel of the River Lee,which runs through the College lower grounds.This association is also reflected in the College motto 'Where Finbarr Taught,Let Munster Learn' which is also the university motto.Adjacent to Gillabbey and overlooking the valley of the river Lee,the site was selected in 1846.[9] The Tudor Gothic quadrangle and early campus buildings were designed and built by Sir Thomas Deane(1792 - 1871) and Benjamin Woodward(1816 - 1861).Queen 's College Cork officially opened its doors in 1849, with further buildings added later, including the Medical/Windle Building in the 1860s.[10]In the following century,the Irish Universities Act(1908) formed the National University of Ireland,consisting of the three constituent colleges of Dublin,Cork and Galway,and the college was given the status of a university college as University College,Cork.The Universities Act,1997,made the university college a constituent university of the National University and made the constituent university a full universityfor all purposes except the awarding of degrees and diplomas which remains the sole remit of the National University.",

The church was damaged in the siege of 1690 and was demolished in 1717 to make way for the current building. The current church was designed in the neoclassical style by John Coltsman and was completed by 1725. It originally had a tower and spire which have been removed. About 1828 the interior was remodelled and a classical three door portico with ionic columns was added to the west front facing Main Street by George Richard Pain. Further alterations were made in 1878 including the installation of a Thomas Christopher Lewis organ. The church has a gabled roof and is constructed of limestone cut stone blocks. The west face of the building has round-headed windows on the upper floor and square-headed on the ground floor and three round-headed doorways. There is a semi-circular apse with round-headed windows on the east side of the building that was added in the nineteenth century. Carving on plaques visible in Christchurch Crypt show the quality of letters that Cork workmen were capable of.The church ceased to be a place of worship in 1978 and was acquired by Cork City Council the following year to house the Cork Archives Institute.Following the relocation of the Archives Institute in 2005 the building underwent refurbishment.In 2011 the Triskel Arts Centre took on the management of the building and is developing it into a cultural and artistic centrefor the city.The church has been fully incorporated into Triskel and is wheelchair accessible,along with lifts and stairs.There is a viewing areafor the crypt so that members of the public can see some of the burial vaults.There is a 16 th century ornate grave slab belonging to former mayor of Cork Thomas Ronan that is often referred to as the Modest Man of Christ Church.Christ Church is open to the publicfor free 9 am - 5 pm Monday to Saturday.The evenings are usuallyset asidefor cinema and music performances.Guided historic tours are available Tuesdays at 12 and Thursdays at 2for€ 3 and last about an hour.The cost of the tour also includes a discount in our café andfor cinema tickets.",

          "story" : "The crypt was built in 1718-20, after the demolition of the old Anglo-Norman church. The floor level of the crypt (as it stands now) may have been the floor level of this church. Many of the prominent families of Cork are buried in the crypt, including a number of former Mayors.The crypt consists of one narrow and 3 wide aisles running on an east - west axis beneath the church.Much of the stone work in the piers is modern and the vaulting is largely brick.The lower coursing of some piers is out of line or uneven and may indicate that the foundations of an earlier crypt survive and perhaps the remains of an older medieval church.There has been some ground disturbance in the crypt in the recent past and it is clear that in addition to the burials in the vaults,many individuals were buried below ground in the crypt.The vaulting is at present less than 2 m above floor level and is less than 1 m under the arches.The low level of the vaulted ceiling in the crypt is attributed to a build up of ground associated with these burials.Burials within the body of the church were common from the mid - 11 th century onwards.Those who could afford it were buried in special places within the church such as close to the chancel or within chantry chapels,as it was believed that proximity to the chancel ensured greater consideration in the after - life.During the 18 th century the wealthy began to construct elaborate tombs and mausoleums based on classically derived architectural motifs such as angels.These tombs are generally associated with the Protestant ascendancy.The use of crypts became a feature common beneath early 18 th century churches like Christchurch.Burials with crypts were generally not interred but the wooden and metal coffins were stacked in locked chambers within vaults.During the 2009 renovation of Christchurch part of the crypt wall of the church was taken away and a glass viewing box was put in place.Two graves were unearthed to allow construction and there are more burials beneath the viewing box floor.The crypt is accessed from a door in the apse to the rear of the church.",

          "story" : "Christchurch, known also as the Holy Trinity, sits discreetly in the background of Bishop Lucey Park on Grand Parade. The entrance to Christchurch is located on South Main Street, once the main street of medieval Cork. Christchurch ceased to function as a place of worship in 1978 due to dwindling congregation numbers and the building was purchased by Cork City Council in 1979 for the sum of £20,000. The Cork Archives Institute resided in Christchurch from 1979 until its relocation to a new purpose-built building in Blackpool in 2005.In 2008 Cork City Council committed to a€ 4.8 m project to restore and develop the historically significant building and they were successful in obtaining€ 2.18 m of funding from EU Structural Funds 2007 - 2013,the European Regional Development Fund and the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly.The refurbishment of Christchurch includes the integration of the Triskel Arts Centre building located next door on Tobin Street.The two buildings are joined to the Church via an extensive glazed link creating a beautiful new venue within the city to house creative performances and visual art.The project design teamfor the refurbishment consisted of Architects Murray Ó Laoire,Consulting Engineers John O’ Donovan & Associates and Quantity Surveyors Bruce Shaw Partnership.Phase 1 of the works was carried out by O’ Shea’ s Builders Cork in 2008. Phase 2 of the works began in November 2009 and was undertaken by Joseph Lane & Sons Ltd.The project involved restoration work on the building’ s stained - glass windows,bell tower,roof,pews,organ,flooring and ceiling.Triskel Christchurch opened its doors in April 2011 and is managed as an arts centre on behalf of Cork City Council.The new building provides an exceptional atmosphere and unique platformfor live performances,events and exhibitions.With the addition of the Christchurch building,Triskel has become an important venuefor Cork’ s many festival programmes such as the Cork Midsummer Festival,Cork Film Festival,Cork Choral Festival and Cork Jazz Festival.In June 2012 we also hosted our first Civil Wedding Ceremony.",

          "story" : "Headless Man Effigy This is part of a recumbent effigy,with the head broken off,on a slab 4 ft 2 in high by 2 ft broad.Some legends have it thatthe head was destroyed during the artillery bombardment of Cork during the Siege of 1690. Many years ago it became known as the‘ Headless Man’ and was the basis of a gruesome story used by local boysfor frightening strangers.The effigy is carved on high relief on a wedge - shaped slab of yellow limestone quarried from Dundry in Somerset,England.Although lacking its head and feet the piece is otherwise in very good condition.The figure wears a long round - necked unwaisted supertunic which is tight across the chest and falls in soft folds at the side of the body.The slightly flared sleeves end at the elbows and there is a tight sleeved tunic underneath.The right hand rests on the upper part of the right hip and the left hand wears a long - cuffed glove and holds the second glove against the left hip.There are traces of plaster under the arms,between the fingers and along the left side of the body.The effigy is missing the head and the footrests,two important indicators of date,but the costume and attitude of the figure help to identify and date it.The style of the supertunic would suggest that the effigy is of a male figure.In addition,gloves would appear to be solely a male attribute.While they are not an item of costume on 13 th century effigies in England they are carried by 5 other male figures in Ireland.The closest parallelfor the Christchurch effigy is the late 13 th century layman at New Ross,County Wexford.The stone is imported from the west of England but the piece is not a direct copy of any English effigy.The style of carving,however,is so close to that of the West Country that the figure was undoubtedly carved by someone familiar with the effigies of that areawhile the glove– carrying attitude provides an Irish dimension to the piece.Traces of plaster on the effigy would suggest that the figure was originally painted.It is impossible to suggest who this effigy might have represented but there is no doubt that it is an important citizen of Cork c .1280 - 90,and probably a wealthy patron of Christchurch.With assistance from the City Archaeologist in April 2012 the effigy was removed from a recess in the crypt and can now be viewed from the crypt viewing box.",

          "story" : "Christchurch was purchased by Cork City Council in 1979 for the sum of £20,000, and as part of this deal a further £10,000 was issued to purchase the organ.The organ was constructed and installed by Englishman T.C.Lewis in 1878 and is one of only two of its kind in Ireland.An earlier organ which was put in place in 1759 by Ferdinand Weber of Dublin was dismantled.Lewis and Company was an important firm of organ builders founded in 1860 by Thomas Christopher Lewis(1833 - 1915).Although trained as an architect,Lewis became one of the leading organ builders of late 19 th Century Britain and includes among his works the Apse Organ in Westminster Abbey(1910) and the Southwark Cathedral Organ in London(1897).Under Lewis’ s direction,the firm built instruments ranging from small chamber organs to major cathedral and concert organs.Lewis was strongly inspired by the organs built in Germany by Edmund Schulze and in France by Aristide Cavaillé - Coll.Lewis was renownedfor making instruments that had a bright,vibrant tone,andfor making instruments that were costly and lavishly built from first class materials.Very few of Lewis’ s larger instruments survive intact and many too,were destroyed during the Second World War.The wind in the Christchurch organ was raised by a‘ double - acting water engine’ driving square - drop feeders.Everything survived intact and in good working order until about 1960,when the water engine and the large double - rise reservoir were removed.An electric blower and makeshift bellows were then installed to replace the water engine.During the recent renovations of Christchurch the organ was dismantled and removedfor refurbishment and repair.The organ was restored by organ specialists Paul Neiland & Associates in Wexford and is now in perfect working order.",

          "story" : "Just opposite Tuckey Street can be seen the Beamish and Crawford Brewery. Beamish and Crawford was a brewery in Cork, Ireland, established in 1792 byWilliam Beamish and William Crawford on the site of an existing porter brewery. Beamish and Crawford operated until 2009 and had a number of owners, including Carling O'Keefe, Elders IXL, Scottish & Newcastle and, most recently, Heineken International. While the Beamish and Crawford brewery closed in 2009, Beamish stout is still brewed in the city, at a nearby Heineken operated facility.The Beamish and Crawford brewery was founded in 1792,when two merchants,William Beamish and William Crawford,went into partnership with two brewers,Richard Barrett and Digby O’ Brien.They purchased an existing brewery(from Edward Allen) on a site in Cramer 's lane that had been used for brewing since at least 1650 (and possibly as early as 1500).Beamish and Crawford 's Cork Porter Brewery prospered, and by 1805 it had become the largest brewery in Ireland and the third largest in the then United Kingdom as a whole. In 1805, its output was 100,000 barrels per annum – up from 12,000 barrels in 1792.[citation needed] It remained the largest brewery in Ireland until overtaken by Guinness in 1833.Beamish Stout,1919 advertfor the noted Cork brewersIn 1865,the brewery underwent a modernisation programme and was completely revamped at a cost of£ 100,000. Alfred Barnard,a noted brewing and distilling historian,remarked in his book Noted Breweries of Great Britain & Ireland in 1889 that: 'The business of Beamish & Crawford in Cork is a very old one dating as far back as the seventeenth century and it is said to be the most ancient porter brewery in Ireland.#The company went public in 1901,issuing a share capital of£ 480,000. Further expansion was aided by the acquisition of a number of local breweries in the early 1900 s.In 1962,it was purchased by the Canadian brewing firm Carling - O 'Keefe Ltd, who embarked on a modernisation programme at the brewery. In 1987, Elders IXL purchased Canadian Breweries (incorporating Carling-O'Keefe).In 1995,Elders sold the brewery to Scottish & Newcastle.With the 2008 takeover of Scottish & Newcastle,the brewery passed into the hands of its main Cork - based rival Heineken International.In December 2008,it was announced that the Beamish and Crawford brewery was to close in March 2009 with the loss of 120 jobs.Production was moved to the nearby Heineken Brewery(previously Murphy 's), with about forty of the Beamish staff moved to Heineken.The brewery buildings(including the Tudor fronted 'counting house') are still in the heart of Cork 's medieval city, close to the South Gate. The original brewery facilities are subject to planning permission for use as a visitor and events centre.Before the takeover and closure of the brewery, beers included:Beamish stout, Beamish and Crawford 's flagship product, now brewed by Heineken at the Murphy's brewery.Beamish Red, a sweetish Irish red ale, made to resemble Kilkenny or Murphy 's Irish Red. Production ceased immediately following the takeover. Several Cork pubs which once stocked Beamish Red replaced it with Franciscan Well Rebel Red.In addition to their own beers, Beamish and Crawford brewed and distributed a number of internationally known brands of beer, with the Irish franchisesfor Fosters, Kronenbourg 1664 and Miller.Fosters has remained with the new owners,while Miller was transferred to a new distributor, importing the beer from SABMiller 's Netherlands brewery.In 2009, after just over two years of being reintroduced to the US market, owners Heineken decided to stop distribution of Beamish products outside Ireland.The story of Cork brewery Beamish and Crawford has been chronicled in detail by historian brothers Donal and Diarmuid Ó Drisceoil.Beamish and Crawford: the History of an Irish Brewery tells not only the story of stout brewing in Cork but the families behind the venture and their interesting offspring, including one Carin Beamish, who married no less a figure than leading Nazi Hermann Goering.“Carin was the great - great - granddaughter of William Beamish and her mother was Swedish– she met Goering in Sweden in 1920 and they married and settled in Munich, where she joined the Nazi party and she helped Goering escape after the failed Beer Hall putsch, ”said Donal.“She died in Sweden in 1931 from tuberculosis and Goering called his country house outside Berlin Carinhall in her memory, ”he added.“He had her remains exhumed in Sweden and reinterred there in a lavish funeral attended by Hitler.”",

          "story" : "Washington Street, is a street in Cork city, Ireland. Built in 1824, it runs from the old medieval town centre onto the western marshes. It was originally named'Great George's Street' in honour of King George III. In 1918, the people of Cork renamed it as a tribute to George Washington. The street itself links the Western Road with the Grand Parade.Notable buildings on Washington Street include the Cork City Courthouse and St Augustine 's Catholic Church.The pedestrian crossing of Washington Street and Grand Parade is one of the busiest in Cork.A foundation stone was erected as part of the Wide Street Commissioner 's most ambitious project. From 1821-30 a major new western axis was driven through the medieval city.In November 1853, parts of Cork city were damaged by a severe flood.The flood destroyed the first St Patrick 's Bridge. The effects of the flood near the Courthouse in present-day Washington Street were significant. At the time Washington Street was called Great George's Street.Washington Street is one of the centres of Cork city 's nightlife with bars, nightclubs, and restaurants located on the street (or close to it) in an area marketed as 'Washington Village'",

          "story" : "Cork City possesses a rich and remarkable history. Unlike other cities it is built on a marsh and an island. The river Lee,on its journey southeastwards,divides and meets again to form an elongated island which,in the earlier days became flooded at high tide. The City of Cork(its name derived from the Gaelic 'Corcaigh', a marsh) was founded here. It grew from small beginnings,a monastery and church founded by St Finbarr.The Augustinians,the Order of St.Augustine,owes its origins to the Saint from Hannaba Hippo in Algeria(354 - 430).St.Augustine inspired men and women to live in religious communities.By the 13 th century many different Augustinians existed.In 1256 Pope Alexander IV created the Grand Union of all existing Augustinian Congregations to form what we know today as the Order of St.Augustine.The Order of St.Augustine came to Cork some time between 1270 and 1300. As the Augustinian historian,Fr.Thomas C.Butler osa writes: 'If we take 1272 as a date of petition for approval to open a foundation in Cork,it would have taken some years for the planning and building of a church and priory (residence).So we can safely assume that the latter took place between 1275 - 1285.The priory was dedicated to the Most Holy trinity,but was recorded on ancient maps as St.Austin 's (1545) and St. Augustine's(1610).Later still it became popularly known as the 'Red Abbey' because of the red sandstone used in the church.The towers were added after the middle of the 14 th century.The main shrine in the church is dedicated to Our Lady of Good Counsel.The annual novena in honour of Our Lady of Good Counsel draws large numbers of people from 17 th - 26 th April each year. Along the side are the mysteries of the Rosary. WindowsThe windows were designed and constructed by Gabriel Loire who was born in Angers,France.He works in slab glass framed cement.These two superb examples of teh artistry of Loire are conceived as two large tapestries in which the two great themes of the Interior,Spiritual Life of the church and her Exterior, Apostolic Life are embroidered.The North WindowThis window symbolises the Interior Life of the Church.The luminous almond shape in the panels,lighted by the star,shows how the Interior Life of the Church is nourished and illuminated by the divine life,which is its source. The alpha and omega indicate that the light and life of God are the source and summit of the Interior Life.The sun resting on a purpled horizon depicts the church in times of difficulty,through which it is sustained by the hope of rebirth to divine life.The South WindowThis window symbolises the expansion of the Kingdom of God trough apostolic activity by sharing the gifts of God with all mankind.The chalice represents the gift of Faith and the anchor symbolises the gift of Hope.The burning heart,emblem of St.Augustine,represents the gift of Love.The seven radiating suns represent the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit.The painting of the Crucifixion over the High Altar was executed in Rome,was put in place in 1824 and cost£ 25. The six candle sticks were donated by a widow in 1776for use on the High Altar.Beneath the shrine of St.Rita is the wood carving of St.Augustine explaining the mystery of the Trinity. Above the shrine of St.Rita is a painting of St.Augustine standing on the head of Satan Blessed William Tirry, Blessed William, a native of Cork,was born in 1608,and Martyred in Clonmel,Co.Tipperary in 1654. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II, along with sixteen Irish martyrs in September 1992. St.Nicholas of Tolentine St.Nicholas was born in Pontano,Italy,in 1245. He joined the Augustinian Order and was ordained in 1271. He spent the last thirty years of his life in Tolentine preaching and ministering to the sick and poor. He died in 1305. He is the patron saint of the 'Holy Souls'. 'St. Augustine at Prayer' was painted at the Prado in Spain and was presented to St.Augustine's in 1963, by the Hon. Gerald Goldberg, Lord Mayor, for the people of Cork.Augustine was born on November 13,354 in Tagaste, North Africa.He was the son of Patricius, a pagan and Monica, a Christian. While still a child Augustine became a catechumen, but was not baptised.He went to the grammar school at Madaura and later to Carthage for further study.It was here that he met a girl who became his mistress and to whom he remained faithful.In 372 she gave him a son, Adoedatus. Through the reading of Cicero's Hortensius, Augustine became deeply interested in philosophy. He joined the Manichean sect. In 374 Augustine returned to Tagaste to teach grammar,and in 375 went to Carthage where he taught rhetoric until 383. From Carthage he went to Milan where he was offered the chair of rhetoric. There he came in contact with with an influential figure,Ambrose,Bishop of Milan.Unconsciously,Augustine absorbed Ambrose 's Christian message.In a garden in Milan in August 386,Augustine heard a child 's voice singing the words: Tolle, lege - take and read, and he opened and read the text of St. Paul's Letter to the Romans(13: 13 - 14). This incident marked Augustine 's conversion to Christianity. He prepared for baptism and was baptised by Ambrose during the Easter Vigil, April 387.In the autumn of 388 Augustine returned to Tagaste where he led a monastic life with his son and a few close friends. His time was spent in prayer, study and the writing of books.In 391,while on a visit to inspect a candidate for his monastery,Augustine went into the basilica at Hippo,whereupon the people present insisted on having him as their priest.Augustine resisted,but was forced to yield to the peoples importunity,much against his will.He was ordained a priest in the same year.However,he made a condition to which he was to remain faithful all his life,that he should be allowed to continue his monastic life while attending to his pastoral duties.That is why he founded a monastery at Hippo.In 395 he was ordained Bishop of Hippo,but continued to ive in his monastic community and to encourage the spread of monasticism in Nort Africa.He wrote a Rule of Life for community and many books,treatises,letters and sermons.Two of his most renowned works are his Confessions and City Of God.Augustine died in 430.
